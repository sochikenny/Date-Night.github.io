# Copy of Date-Night App

This is a copy of my first project at Uconn Bootcamp completed March 21st, 2020

Check out the site: https://sochikenny.github.io/Date-Night.github.io/ (It is functional but still needs some updating)

### Plans for the future development

Since this is my copy, I will turn into strictly a simple app that finds the best food spots in all of Manhattan using Zomato API. 
This application can be useful to anyone who's new to the city and wants to find a good spot to eat.
